# Frogger
This is a game based on the classic Frogger game made by Konami in 1981. While some of the gameplay features might not be present, most of them are included within this game. Please read the Instructions pdf to have a clearer picture on how the game is supposed to be played. 

## Development

There are two ways to run the code:

1. Build the code and then open the web page

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run build`
- Open the html file dist/index.html (NOT src/index.html)

2. Use the development server

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`, this will automatically open a web page at localhost:4000
- Open localhost:4000 in your browser if it didn't already

The development server will have some additional features that help with the
development process, but are not essential.
